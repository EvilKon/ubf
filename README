UNIVERSAL BINARY FORMAT

This is the original UBF(A) encoder/decoder by Joe Armstrong. All I have done 
is to update it to remove compile time warnings generated by the later versions 
of Erlang/OTP (Currently R13A).

SEE: http://www.sics.se/~joe/ubf/site/home.html

What you need to know:

"UBF(A) is a data transport format, roughly equivalent to well-formed XML."

To use this module, you need to know nothing more than:

ubf:encode(Term).
ubf:decode(Ubf).

Updating and organizing the remainder of these files especially contracts is a
work in progress.
